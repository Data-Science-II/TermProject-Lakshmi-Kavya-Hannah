# TermProject-Lakshmi-Kavya-Hannah

This is our Final Term Project for Data Science 2. 

We participated in the Data Science Competition and used the Wells Fargo banking data to predict which applicants were defaulted or not defaulted. 

The three datasets are the nonprocessed entries with ull values which we clean up in our code when analyzing. Tese are the raw datasets that were provided to us. 

The report contains a detailed documentation for the processwe followed thought out the competition. It describes the models we used and what appraoched we took to determine the best model. 

Finally, the .ipyb file contains all the Python code we did to output the models and help analyze the data.
